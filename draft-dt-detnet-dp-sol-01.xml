 <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_intro">
  <t>
   This document specifies Deterministic Networking (DetNet) data plane
   solutions. Two solutions are given. 
     <list style="symbols">
		<t>PW-based: One solution is based on PseudoWires (PW) <xref target="RFC3985"/>
		and makes use of the multi-segment (MS-PW) <xref target="RFC6073"/> to map
		DetNet Relay and Edge Nodes <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/> 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-alt"/> to PW architecture. The PW-based 
		data plane can be run over an MPLS <xref target="RFC4448"/> 
		<xref target="RFC6658"/> Packet Switched Network (PSN).</t>
		<t>Native-IP: The other solution is based on IP header fields, namely on 
		IPv6 Flow label and a new DetNet Control Word extension header option. 
		It is targeted for native IPv6 networks.   
		</t>
  </list>
  </t>
  <t>
   This document specifies the encapsulation for DetNet flows, to include a 
   DetNet Control Word (CW), a DetNet flow identification. Furthermore it describes how DetNet Relay 
   and Edge nodes work, and how the Packet Replication and Elimination function
   (PREF) is implemented with these two data plane solutions. This document does not define the
   associated control plane functions, or operations and management (OAM).
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Terminology">
  <t>
   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet architecture
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/> and the DetNet Data Plane
   Solution Alternatives <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-alt"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
   The following terms are also used in this document:
   <list style="hanging" hangIndent="14">
    <t hangText="DA-T-PE">MPLS based DetNet edge node: a DetNet aware PseudoWire Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE).</t>
    <t hangText="DA-S-PE">MPLS based DetNet relay node: a DetNet aware PseudoWire Switching Provider Edge (S-PE).</t>
    <t hangText="T-Label">A hop-by-hop tunnel label layer between label switching routers (LSR).</t>
    <t hangText="L-Label">A DetNet topology overlay label that is used between DA-*-PE devices.</t>
	<t hangText="PW Label">
     A PseudoWire label that is used to identify DetNet flow related PW Instances within a PE node.</t> 
	<t hangText="Flow Label">
     IPv6 header field that is used to identify a DetNet flow (together with the source IP address field).</t> 
    <t hangText="local-ID">
     An edge and relay node internal construct that uniquely identifies a DetNet flow. 
	 It may be used to select proper forwarding and/or DetNet specific service function.</t>
    <t hangText="PREF">
     A Packet Replication and Elimination Function (PREF) does the replication
     and elimination processig of DetNet flow packets in edge or relay
     nodes. The replication function is essentially the existing 1+1 protection
     mechanism. The elimination function reuses and extends the existing duplicate 
	 detection mechanism to operate over multiple (separate) sub-flows of a 
	 compound DetNet flow.</t>

  <t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL"
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

   <xref target="fig_8021_detnet"/> illustrates how DetNet can provide services
   for IEEE 802.1TSN end systems over a DetNet enabled network.  The edge nodes
   insert and remove required DetNet data plane encapsulation.  The 'X' in
   the edge and relay nodes represents a potential DetNet flow packet
   replication and elimination point.  This conceptually parallels L2VPN
   services, and could leverage existing related solutions as discussed
   below.

  <xref target="fig_native_detnet"/> illustrates how end to end DetNet service
  can be provided. In this case, the end systems are able to send and receive
  DetNet flows.  For example, put application data in PseudoWire (PW) and
  encapsulated in MPLS.  Like earlier the 'X' in the end systems, edge and relay
  nodes represents potential DetNet flow packet replication and elimination
  points. Here the relay nodes may change the underlying transport, for example
  tunneling IP over MPLS, or simply interconnect network segments.

<section title="DetNet data plane solution requirements">
 <t>
 Two major groups of scenarios can be distinguished which require flow
 identification during transport:
 </t>

 <t><list style="numbers">
  <t>DetNet function related scenarios:
  <list style="symbols">
   <t>Congestion protection: usage of allocated resources (queuing, policing, shaping).</t>
   <t>Explicit routes: select/apply the flow specific path.</t>
   <t>Service protection: recognize compound / member flows for replication an elimination.</t>
  </list>
 </t>
 <t>OAM function related scenarios:
  <list style="symbols">
   <t>troubleshooting (e.g., identify misbehaving flows, etc.)</t>
   <t>recognize flow(s) for analytics (e.g, increase counters, etc.)</t>
   <t>correlate events with flows (e.g., volume above threshold, etc.)</t>
   <t>etc.</t>
  </list>
 </t>
 </list></t>
 <t>
  Each node (edge, relay and transit) use a local-ID of the DetNet-(compound)-flow in
  order to accomplish its role during transport. Recognizing the DetNet flow is more
  relaxed for edge and relay nodes, as they are fully aware of both the DetNet
  service and transport layers. The DetNet role of intermediate transport nodes is
  limited to ensure congestion protection from the above listed DetNet
  functions. However, transit nodes may have limited capabilities to reconize DetNet 
  specific fields (e.g., in case of MPLS the PW label). Therefore, identifying each
  individual DetNet flow on a transit node may not be achieved in some network
  scenarios.
 </t>

 <t>
  On each node dealing with DetNet flows, a local-ID is assumed to determine what
  local operation a packet goes through. Therefore, local-IDs MUST be unique on
  each edge and relay nodes. Local-ID MUST be unambiguously bound to the
  DetNet flow.

  <section title="Native IPv6-based dataplane solution" anchor="v6Solution">

   <t>
    <xref target="fig_native_ip"/> illustrates a DetNet native IPv6 encapsulation.  The native IPv6
    encapsulation is meant for end to end Detnet service use cases, where the end stations are
    DetNet aware (see <xref target="fig_native_detnet"/>). Technically it is possible to use the
    IPv6 encapsulation to tunnel any traffic over a DetNet enabled network, which would make native
    IPv6 encapsulation also a valid data plane choice for an interconnect use case (see <xref
    target="fig_8021_detnet"/>).
   </t>

  <t>
   The native IPv6-based DetNet dataplane encapsulation consists of:
   <list style="symbols">
    <t>IPv6 header as the transport protocol.</t>
    <t>IPv6 header Flow Label that is used to help to identify a DetNet flow (i.e., roughly
        an equivalent to the PW Label). A Flow Label together with the IPv6 source address

  </t>

  <t>
   A DetNet-aware end station (a host) or an intermediate node initiating an IPv6 packet is
   responsible for setting the Flow Label, adding the required DetNet Destination Option, and possibly
   adding a routing header such as the segment routing option (for pre-defined paths <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header"/>). The payload of the native IPv6
   encapsulation is any payload protocol that can be identified using the Next Header field either
   in the IPv6 packet header or in the last IPv6 extension header.
  </t>
  <t>
   A DetNet-aware end station (a host) or an intermediate node receiving an IPv6 packet destined
   to it and containing a DetNet Destination Option does the approproate processing of the
   packet. This may involve packet duplication and elimination (PREF processing), terminating a tunnel or
   delivering the packet to the upper layers/Applications.

  <section title="PREF specific considerations">
   <section title="Forwarded clarifications">
   <t>
    The DetNet specific new functionality in an edge or relay node processing is the packet replication and
    duplication elimination function (PREF). This function is a part of the DetNet-aware
    "extended" forwarder. The PREF processing is triggered by the received packet of a DetNet flow. 
	Basically the forwarding entry has to be extended with a "PREF
    enabled" boolean configuration switch that is associated with the normal forwarding actions (e.g.,
    in case of MPLS a swap, push, pop, ..). The output of the PREF elimination function is always a single packet.
    The output of the PREF replication function is always one or more packets (i.e., 1:M
    replication). The replicated packets MUST share the same DetNet control word sequence number.
   </t>
   <t>
    The complex part of the DetNet PREF processing is tracking the history of received packets for
    multiple sub-flows. These ingress sub-flows (to a node) MUST have the same local-ID if they belong to
    the same DetNet-(compound)-flow and share the same sequence number counter and the history information.
   </t>
   <t>
    The edge and relay node internal procedures of the PREF are implementation specific.  The order of a packet
    elimination or replication is out of scope in this specification. However, care should be taken
    that the replication function does not actually loopback packets as "replicas". Looped back
    packets include artificial delay when the node that originally initiated the packet receives it
    again. Also, looped back packets may make the network condition to look healtier than it
    actually is (in some cases link failures are not reflected properly because looped back packets
    make the situation appear better than it actually is).

     The DetNet data plane solution overloads the edge node with DetNet
     Edge Node functions. Edge nodes

	 <xref target="fig_detnet_edge"/> illustrates the overall edge device
     functions. The figure shows both physical attachment circuit (AC) (e.g.,
     Ethernet <xref target="RFC4448"/>) connecting to the edge node, and a packet
     service connecting to the edge node via an embedded router function 
	 (similarly as described e.g., in <xref target="RFC6658"/>). Whether traffic flow from from a client
     AC and PSN tunnel receives DetNet specific treatment is up to a local
     configuration and policy.

     An edge node participates to the packet replication and duplication elimination. Required
     processing is done within an extended forwarder function. In the case the native service
     processing (NSP) is IEEE 802.1CB <xref target="IEEE8021CB"/> capable, the packet replication
     and duplicate elimination MAY entirely be done in the NSP and bypassing the DetNet flow
     encapsulation and logic entirely, and thus is able to operate over unmodified implementation
     and deployment. The NSP approach works only between edge nodes and cannot make use of relay nodes
     (see <xref target="sec_s_pe"/>).
    </t>
    <t>
     The DetNet-aware extended forwarder selects the egress sub-flow based on the DetNet forwarding rules.
	 In both "normal AC" and "Packet AC"
     cases there may be no DetNet encapsulation header available yet as it is the case with relay nodes
     (see <xref target="sec_s_pe"/>).  It is the responsibility of the extended forwarder within the
     edge node to push the DetNet specific encapsulation (if not already present) to the packet before
     forwarding it to the appropriate egress sub-flow instance(s). The extended forwarder MAY copy the
     sequencing information from the native DetNet packet into the DetNet sequence number field and vice versa. If there is no
     existing sequencing information available in the native packet or the forwarder chose not to
     copy it from the native packet, then the extended forwarder MUST maintain a sequence number
     counter for each DetNet flow (indexed by the DetNet flow identification).

     The DetNet data plane solution overloads a relay node with DetNet
     Relay node functions. Relay node is aware of DetNet flows and may operate upon those. 
	 <xref target="fig_detnet_relay"/> illustrates the overall DetNet relay device
     functions.
    </t>
    <t>
     A DetNet Relay node participates to the packet replication and duplication
     elimination. This processing is done within an extended forwarder function.
     Whether an ingress sub-flow receives DetNet specific processing depends on how
     the forwarding is programmed.  For some sub-flows the relay node can act as a normal relay node
     and for some apply the DetNet specific processing (i.e., PREF). It is also possible to
     treat the relay node as a transit node using tunneling (e.g., via L-labels in case of MPLS PSN). Again, this is
     entirely up to how the forwarding has been programmed.
    </t>
    <t>
     The DetNet-aware forwarder selects the egress sub-flow segment based on the flow identification.  
	 The mapping of ingress sub-flow segment to egress sub-flow segment may be
     statically or dynamically configured. Additionally the DetNet-aware
     forwarder does duplicate frame elimination based on the flow identification and
     the sequence number combination. The packet replication is
     also done within the DetNet-aware forwarder. During elimination and the
     replication process the sequence number of the sub-flow MUST
     be preserved and copied to the egress sub-flow.

 <section title="Class of Service">
  <t>
   A DetNet flow Class of Service (CoS) MUST always be encoded into the
   currently most outer header, using MPLS label TC bits, or IP packet

   layer at which the end system or network node is operating.

 <section title="Quality of Service">
  <t>
   In addition to path pinning and packet replication and elimination, described in
   Section <xref target="dn-dt-solution"/> above, DetNet provides zero congestion loss
   and bounded end-to-end latency for DetNet flows.  As described in
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>, this requires that resources be reserved
   for classes of DetNet flows, or even for individual flows, before the DetNet QoS
   can be supplied to those flows.  Resources can be reserved using protoocls or by
   configuration.  Resource reservation is beyond the scope of this document.
  </t><t>
   Packets that are marked with a DetNet Class of Service value, but that have not been
   the subject of a completed reservation, can disrupt the QoS offered to properly
   reserved DetNet flows by using resources allocated to the reserved flows.  Therefore,
   the network nodes of a DetNet network SHOULD:
  </t><t>
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
          Defend the DetNet QoS by discarding or remarking (to a non-DetNet CoS)
          packets received that are not the subject of a completed reservation.
      </t><t>
          Not use a DetNet reserved resource, e.g. a queue or shaper reserved for
          DetNet flows, for any packet that does not carry a DetNet Class of Service
          marker.

 <section title="Time synchronization">

   [Editor's note: describe a bit of issues and deployment considerations

   slides that summarize different approaches and rough synchronization
   performance numbers.  Finally, scope time-synchronization solution outside
   data plane.]
  </t>


  <t>When DetNet is used, there is an underlying assumption that the
  applicaiton(s) require clock synchronization such as the Precision Time Protocol
  (PTP) [IEEE1588]. The relay nodes may or may not utilize clock synchronization
  in order to provide congestion-free QoS.  In either case, there are a
  few possible approaches of
  how synchronization protocol packets are forwarded and handled by the
  network:</t>

  <t><list style="symbols">
      
    <t>
    PTP packets can be sent either as DetNet flows or as high-priority
    best effort packets.  Using DetNet for PTP packets requires careful
    consideration to prevent unwanted interactions between clock-synchronized
    network nodes and the packets that synchronize the clocks.
    </t>
    <t>PTP packets are sent as a normal DetNet flow through network nodes
    that are not time-synchronized: in this approach PTP
    traffic is forwarded as a DetNet flow, and as such it is forwarded in a
    way that allows a low delay variation. However, since intermediate nodes
    do not take part in the synchronization protocol, this approach provides
    a relatively low degree of accuracy.</t>

    <t>PTP with on-path support: in this approach PTP packets are sent as
    ordinary or as DetNet flows, and intermediate nodes take part in the protocol as
    Transparent Clocks or Boundary Clocks [IEEE1588]. The on-path PTP
    support by intermediate nodes provides a higher degree of accuracy than
    the previous approach. The actual accuracy depends on whether all
    intermediate nodes are PTP-capable, or only a subset of them.</t>
  
    <t>Time-as-a-service: in this approach accurate time is provided
    as-a-service to the DetNet source and destination, as well as the
    intermediate nodes. Since traffic between the source and destination is
    sent over a provider network, if the provider supports
    time-as-a-service, then accurate time can be provided to both the source
    and the destination of DetNet traffic. This approach can potentially
    provide the highest degree of accuracy.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>It is expected that the latter approach will be the most common one,
  as it provides the highest degree of accuracy, and creates a layer
  separation between the DetNet data and the synchronization service.</t>

  <t>It should be noted that in all four approaches it is not recommended
  to use replication and elimination for synchronization packets; the
  replication/elimination approach may in some cases reduce the
  synchronization accuracy, since the observed path delay will be
  bivalent.</t>

 <section title="Bidirectional traffic">
  <t>
   Some DetNet applications generate bidirectional traffic and may require
   symmetric flows. There are already mechanisms that can be used to create
   bidirectional tunnels at the transport network level, such as MPLS-TP. The
   data plane solution SHOULD allow establishing bidirectional symmetric flows.
   DetNet provides no special bidirectional features in the data plane other
   than need for the two directions take the same paths.
   Control plane mechanisms would need to also support this, though this is out
   of scope of this document.  [Summary of existing mechanisms to create
   bidirectional tunnels that can be used.]

 <section title="Packet replication and elimination function">
     <t>
         [editor's note: collect details of the PREF here. Potential topics to discuss relate to
         constraints to input packets and what the expected output is. Some examples include: the
         input packets must have the same PW Label (in a case of PWs) to enable the PREF, no
         loopback for replicated packets, input and output PW labels do not need to be the same.
         Also, add text regarding native IPv6 encapsulation. There the PW label is replaced with
         source address + flow label combination, and the Control Word is replaced with the DetNet
         Destination Option.. etc]

 <section title="Layer 2 addressing and QoS onsiderations">
    <t>
        The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group have
        defined (and are defining) a number of amendments to <xref target="IEEE8021Q">IEEE 802.1Q</xref>
        that provide zero congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged networks.
        <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines packet replication and elimination
        functions that should prove both compatible with and useful to, DetNet networks.
    </t><t>
        As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge may need to
        identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet belongs in order to provide the
        TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It also will likely need a CoS marking, such as the
        priority field of an IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.
    </t><t>
        Although the flow identification methods described in <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>
        are flexible, and in fact, include IP 5-tuple identification methods, the baseline
        TSN standards assume that every Ethernet frame belonging to a TSN stream
        (i.e. DetNet flow) carries a multicast destination MAC address that is unique to that
        flow within the bridged network over which it is carried.  Furthermore,
        <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> describes three methods by which a packet
        sequence number can be encoded in an Ethernet frame.
    </t><t>
        Ensuring that the proper Ethernet VLAN tag priority and destination MAC address
        are used on a DetNet/TSN packet may require further clarification of the customary
        L2/L3 transformations carried out by routers and edge label switches.  Edge nodes
        may also have to move sequence number fields among Layer 2, PW, and IPv6 encapsulations.

 <section title="PW Label and IPv6 Flow Label assignment and distribution">
  <t>
   The PW label distribution follows the same mechanisms specified for MS-PW <xref

   distribution and the management of the label number space are out of scope of this document. 
  </t>
  <t>
   The IPv6 Flow Label distribution and the label number space are out of scope of this document.
   However, it should be noted that the combination of the IPv6 source address and the IPv6 Flow
   Label is assumed to be unique within the DetNet enable network. Therefore, as long as each node
   is able to assign unique Flow Labels for the source address(es) it is using the DetNet enabled
   network wide flow identification uniqueness is quaranteed.
