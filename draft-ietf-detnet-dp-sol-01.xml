   <t>
    This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane encapsulation solutions. The
    described data plane solutions can be applied over either IP or MPLS Packet Switched Networks.
   </t>
  </abstract>
  </front>

 <middle>
 <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_intro">
  <t>
    Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a network to DetNet flows.
    DetNet provides these flows extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
    delivery latency.  General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    This document specifies the DetNet data plane and the on-wire encapsulation of DetNet flows. The
    specified encapsulation provides the building blocks to enable the DetNet service layer
    functions and allow flow identification as described in the DetNet Architecture. Two data plane
    definitions are given. 
     <list style="numbers">
		<t>MPLS-based: The enacapsulation resembles PseudoWires (PW) with an MPLS Packet Switched
           Network (PSN) <xref target="RFC3985"/><xref target="RFC4385"/>.
        </t>
        <t>Native-IP-based: The encapsulating protocol is IPv6 and the solution relies on IP header
           fields, existing and DetNet specific IPv6 eaxtension header options <xref target="RFC8200"/>.
		</t>
    </list>
    <list><t>[Editor's note: MPLS- and IPv6-based solutions are likely to be split into different
    documents.]</t></list>
  </t>
  <t>
    It is worth noting that while MPLS-based solution can transport IP packets a native-IP solution
    is meant for deployments where the DetNet service layer functions are provided at the IP-layer
    rather than the underlying transport network. The primary reason for this is the benefit gained
    by enabling the use of a normal application stack, where transport protocols such as TCP or UDP
    are directly encapsulated in IP.
  </t>
  <t>
    The DetNet transport layer functionality that provides congestion protection for DetNet flows
    is assumed to be in place in a DetNet node.
  </t>
  <t>
   Furthermore, this document also describes how DetNet flows are identified, how a DetNet
   Relay/Edge/Transit nodes work, and how the Packet Replication and Elimination function (PREF) is
   implemented with the two data plane solutions.
  </t>
  <t>
   This document does not define the associated control plane functions, or Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  It also does not specify traffic handling capabilities
   required to deliver congestion protection and latency control for DetNet flows at the DetNet
   transport layer.

 <section title="DetNet data plane overview" anchor="sec_dt_dp">
  <t>
   This document describes how to use IP and/or MPLS to support a data plane method of flow
   identification and packet formwarding over layer-3. Two different cases are covered: (i) the
   inter-connect scenario, in which IEEE802.1 TSN is routed over a layer-3 network (i.e., to enlarge
   the layer-2 domain), and (ii) native connectivity between DetNet-aware end systems.
  </t>
  <t>
   <xref target="fig_8021_detnet"/> illustrates how DetNet can provide services for IEEE 802.1TSN
   end systems over a DetNet enabled network.  The edge nodes insert and remove required DetNet data
   plane encapsulation.  The 'X' in the edge and relay nodes represents a potential DetNet flow
   packet replication and elimination point.  This conceptually parallels L2VPN services, and could
   leverage existing related solutions as discussed below.

  an end system sends data encapsulated in MPLS.  Like earlier the 'X' in the end systems, edge and
  relay nodes represents potential DetNet flow packet replication and elimination points. Here the
  relay nodes may change the underlying transport, for example tunneling IP over MPLS, or simply
  interconnect network segments.

 <t>
 Two major groups of scenarios can be distinguished which require flow
 identification during transport:
 </t>

 <t><list style="numbers">
  <t>DetNet function related scenarios:
  <list style="symbols">
   <t>Congestion protection and latency control: usage of allocated resources (queuing, policing, shaping).</t>
   <t>Explicit routes: select/apply the flow specific path.</t>
   <t>Service protection: recognize DetNet compound and member flows for replication an elimination.</t>
  </list>
    <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Comment #12">
            I am not sure whether the correct architectural construct is flow
            or flow group. Flow suggests that sharing/aggregation is not allowed
            but whether this is allowed or not is an application specific issue.
           </t>
	   <t hangText="Discussion:">
            Agree that a flow group would be a better characterization. 
  	 </t>
	   <t hangText="Comment #13">
            I think that there needs to be some clarification as to whether FG is
            is understood by the DN system exclusively or whether there is an 
            expectation that it is understood by the underlay.
           </t>
	   <t hangText="Discussion:">
            Agree that more detail is needed here. DetNet aware nodes need to
	    understand flow groups. Underlay needs to be aware of flow groups at
	    the resource allocation level.
  	 </t>
	</list>
 </t>
 <t>OAM function related scenarios:
  <list style="symbols">
   <t>troubleshooting (e.g., identify misbehaving flows, etc.)</t>
   <t>recognize flow(s) for analytics (e.g., increase counters, etc.)</t>
   <t>correlate events with flows (e.g., volume above threshold, etc.)</t>
   <t>etc.</t>
  </list>
 </t>
 </list></t>
 <t>
  Each DetNet node (edge, relay and transit) use an internal/implementation specific local-ID of the
  DetNet-(compound)-flow in order to accomplish its role during transport. Recognizing the DetNet
  flow is more relaxed for edge and relay nodes, as they are fully aware of both the DetNet service
  and transport layers. The primary DetNet role of intermediate transport nodes is limited to
  ensuring congestion protection and latency control for the above listed DetNet functions.
 </t>
 <t>
  The DetNet data plane allows for the aggregation of DetNet flows, e.g., via MPLS hierarchical
  LSPs, to improved scaling.  When DetNet flows are aggregated, transit nodes may have limited
  ability to provide service on per-flow DetNet identifiers. Therefore, identifying each individual
  DetNet flow on a transit node may not be achieved in some network scenarios, but DetNet service
  can still be assured in these scenarios through resource allocation and control.
    <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Comment #14">
           You could introduce the concept of a flow group identified into the
           packet. You may also include a flow id at a lower layer.
           </t>
	  <t hangText="Discussion:">
		  Agree on the identification properties. Adding a specific id into actual
		  on-wire formats is not necessarily needed.
	  </t>
	</list>
 </t>

 <t>
  On each DetNet node dealing with DetNet flows, an internal local-ID is assumed to determine what
  local operation a packet goes through. Therefore, local-IDs has to be unique on each edge and
  relay nodes. Local-ID is unambiguously bound to the DetNet flow.

    (see <xref target="fig_8021_detnet"/>).  Furthermore, end to end DetNet service i.e., native
    DetNet deployment (see <xref target="fig_pw_detnet"/>) is also possible if DetNet end systems
    are capable of initiating and termination MPLS encapsulated packets. Transport of IP
    encapsulated DetNet flows, see <xref target="v6Solution"/>, over MPLS-based DetNet data plane is
    also possible.  Interworking between PW- and IPv6-based encapsulations is discussed further in

    <t>
     One or more MPLS transport LSP label(s) (T-label) which may be a hop-by-hop label used between

     PHPed before arriving at a DetNet node. In general T-labels should be considered to be part of
     the underlying transport network rather the actual DetNet data plane encapsulation.

  <section title="Flow identification">   
   <t>
    DetNet flow identification at a DetNet service layer is realized by a DetNet label. It maps
    a Detnet flow to a specific d-CW in a DetNet node. The DetNet label MUST at the bottom of the
    label stack for a DetNet-s- or DetNet-st-flow and MUST precede the d-CW. 
   </t>
   <t>
    A DetNet label for a single DetNet flow does not need to be unique DetNet domain wide. As long
    as two or more different DetNet flows do not errorneously map to a same d-CW in a DetNet node
    the labels may vary. 
   </t>
  </section>
  
   <section title="Service layer considerations">
   	<t>
     The DetNet specific new functionality in a DetNet edge or relay node processing is the packet
     replication and duplication elimination function (PREF). The PREF processing is only applied to
     packets with the DetNet label exposed to and identified at the DetNet service layer in a DetNet
     node.
    </t>
    <t>
     [Editor's note: Need major rework in this Section.]
    </t>
    <t>
     Basically the forwarding entry has to be extended with a "PREF
     enabled" boolean configuration switch that is associated with the normal forwarding actions (e.g.,
     in case of MPLS a swap, push, pop, ..). The output of the PREF elimination function is always a single packet.
     The output of the PREF replication function is always one or more packets (i.e., 1:M
     replication). The replicated packets MUST share the same DetNet control word sequence number.
   </t>
   <t>
     The complex part of the DetNet PREF processing is tracking the history of received packets for
     multiple DetNet member flows. These ingress DetNet member flows (to a node) MUST have the same local-ID if they belong to
     the same DetNet-(compound)-flow and share the same sequence number counter and the history information.
   </t>
   <t>
     The edge and relay node internal procedures of the PREF are implementation specific.  The order of a packet
     elimination or replication is out of scope in this specification. However, care should be taken
     that the replication function does not actually loopback packets as "replicas". Looped back
     packets include artificial delay when the node that originally initiated the packet receives it
     again. Also, looped back packets may make the network condition to look healthier than it
     actually is (in some cases link failures are not reflected properly because looped back packets
     make the situation appear better than it actually is). 
     <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Comment #29:">
           SB> There needs to be some text about preventing a node ever receiving its
           own replicated packets. Indeed that would suggest that the flow
           id should be changed and replication should only take place on 
           configured flow IDs. I have a feeling that this would all be a lot safer if replication
           only happened at ingress and we managed the diversity of the paths.

     An edge node participates to the packet replication and duplication elimination. Required
     processing is done within an extended forwarder function. In the case the native service
     processing (NSP) is IEEE 802.1CB <xref target="IEEE8021CB"/> capable, the packet replication
     and duplicate elimination MAY entirely be done in the NSP and bypassing the DetNet flow
     encapsulation and logic entirely, and thus is able to operate over unmodified implementation
     and deployment. The NSP approach works only between edge nodes and cannot make use of relay nodes
     (see <xref target="sec_s_pe"/>).
    <list style="hanging">

		   SB> This would be a fine way to operate the PW system - edge to edge.

	   <t hangText="Discussion:">
		   When it comes to use of NSPs, agree. Also for "island interconnect" this is

     The DetNet-aware extended forwarder selects the egress DetNet member flow based on the DetNet forwarding rules.
	 In both "normal AC" and "Packet AC"
     cases there may be no DetNet encapsulation header available yet as it is the case with relay nodes
     (see <xref target="sec_s_pe"/>).  It is the responsibility of the extended forwarder within the
     edge node to push the DetNet specific encapsulation (if not already present) to the packet before
     forwarding it to the appropriate egress DetNet member flow instance(s).
    <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Comment #32">
	   SB> I am not convinced of the wisdom of having a mid-point node convert
           a flow into a DN flow, which is what you are implying here. This seems

      The extended forwarder MAY copy the sequencing information from the native DetNet packet into
      the DetNet sequence number field and vice versa. If there is no existing sequencing
      information available in the native packet or the forwarder chose not to copy it from the
      native packet, then the extended forwarder MUST maintain a sequence number counter for each
      DetNet flow (indexed by the DetNet flow identification).

    <t>
     A DetNet Relay node participates to the packet replication and duplication
     elimination. This processing is done within an extended forwarder function.
     Whether an ingress DetNet member flow receives DetNet specific processing depends on how
     the forwarding is programmed.  For some DetNet member flows the relay node can act as a normal relay node
     and for some apply the DetNet specific processing (i.e., PREF).
    <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Comment #34">
           SB> Again relay node is not a normal term, so am not sure what it does
            in the absence of a PREF function.
           </t>
	   <t hangText="Discussion:">
		   Relay node was a DetNet aware S-PE originally, which is not explicitly stated here anymore, thus
                   slightly confusing text here. The text here needs to clarify the roles of PREF and switching
		   functions. A DetNet relay is described in the architecture document. However, there is definitely
		   room for termonilogy and text improvements.
  	 </t>
	</list>
     </t>

     <t> It
     is also possible to
     treat the relay node as a transit node, see <xref target="Aggregation"/>.
     Again, this is
     entirely up to how the forwarding has been programmed.
    </t>
    <t>
     The DetNet-aware forwarder selects the egress DetNet member flow segment based on the flow identification.  
	 The mapping of ingress DetNet member flow segment to egress DetNet member flow segment may be
     statically or dynamically configured. Additionally the DetNet-aware
     forwarder does duplicate frame elimination based on the flow identification and
     the sequence number combination. The packet replication is
     also done within the DetNet-aware forwarder. During elimination and the
     replication process the sequence number of the DetNet member flow MUST
     be preserved and copied to the egress DetNet member flow.

    <xref target="fig_native_ip"/> illustrates a DetNet native IPv6 encapsulation.  The native IPv6
    encapsulation is meant for end to end Detnet service use cases, where the end stations are
    DetNet-aware (see <xref target="fig_ip_detnet"/>). Technically it is possible to use the
    IPv6 encapsulation to tunnel any traffic over a DetNet enabled network, which would make native
    IPv6 encapsulation also a valid data plane choice for an interconnect use case (see <xref

     IPv6 header Flow Label that is used to help to identify a DetNet flow (i.e., roughly an

           RFC6437 does not restrict such use and DetNet DP solution can always define their own use

   A DetNet-aware end station (a host) or an intermediate Detnet node initiating an (or adding a

   as the segment routing option (for pre-defined paths <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header"/>).  If a routing header is inserted into the IPv6
   packet for DetNet-s- or DetNet-st-flows then a second copy of the DetNet Destination Option MUST
   be added before the routing header (see Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC8200"/>).

   A DetNet-aware end station (a host) or an intermediate node receiving an IPv6 packet destined

   <section title="Flow identification">
    <t>
        The DetNet flow identification is based on the IPv6 Flow Label and the source address
        combination. The two fields uniquelly identify the end to end native IPv6 encapsulated
        DetNet flow. Obviously, the identification fails if any intermediate node modifies
        either the source address or the Flow Label.

 <section title="Class of Service">
   <t>
     Class and quality of service, i.e., CoS and QoS, are terms that are
     often used interchangeably and confused.  In the context of DetNet,
     CoS is used to refer to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding
     treatment based on aggregate group basis and QoS is used to refer
     to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding treatment based on a
     specific DetNet flow basis.  Examples of existing network level CoS
     mechanisms include DiffServ which is enabled by IP header
     differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
     target="RFC2474"/> and MPLS label traffic class field <xref
     target="RFC5462"/>, and at Layer-2, by IEEE 802.1p priority code
     point (PCP).
   </t>
   <t>
     CoS for DetNet flows carried in PWs and MPLS is provided using the
     existing MPLS Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture <xref
     target="RFC3270"/>.  Both E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes MAY
     be used to support DetNet flows.  The Traffic Class field (formerly
     the EXP field) of an MPLS label follows the definition of <xref
     target="RFC5462"/> and <xref target="RFC3270"/>.  The Uniform,
     Pipe, and Short Pipe DiffServ tunneling and TTL processing models
     are described in <xref target="RFC3270"/> and <xref
     target="RFC3443"/> and MAY be used for MPLS LSPs supporting DetNet
     flows. MPLS ECN MAY also be used as defined in ECN <xref
     target="RFC5129"/> and updated by <xref target="RFC5462"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
     CoS for DetNet flows carried in IPv6 is provided using the standard
     differentiated services code point (DSCP) field <xref
     target="RFC2474"/> and related mechanisms.  The 2-bit explicit
     congestion notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/> field MAY
     also be used.
  </t>
  <t>
    One additional consideration for DetNet nodes which support CoS
    services is that they MUST ensure that the CoS service classes do
    not impact the congestion protection and latency control mechanisms
    used to provide DetNet QoS.  This requirement is similar to
    requirement for MPLS LSRs to that CoS LSPs do not impact the
    resources allocated to TE LSPs via <xref target="RFC3473"/>.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Quality of Service">
    <t>
     Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms for flow specific traffic treatment
     typically includes a guarantee/agreement for the service, and allocation of
     resources to support the service.  Example QoS mechanisms include discrete
     resource allocation, admission control, flow identification and isolation,
     and sometimes path control, traffic protection, shaping, policing and
     remarking. Example protocols that support QoS control include <xref
     target="RFC2205">Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)</xref> (RSVP) and
     RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  The
     existing MPLS mechanisms defined to support CoS <xref
     target="RFC3270"/> can also be used to reserve resources for
     specific traffic classes. 
    </t>
    <t>
      In addition to path pinning and packet replication and
      elimination, described in <xref target="dn-dt-solution"/> above,
      DetNet provides zero congestion loss and bounded latency and
      jitter.
    <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Comment #36">
            SB> I just searched from the beginning of the document and this was the

		    Terminology isssue. Should use, for example, explicit paths which is

  	 </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>As described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/>, there are different
      mechanisms that maybe used separately or in combination to deliver
      a zero congestion loss service.  These mechanisms are provided by
      the either the MPLS or IP layers, and may be combined with the
      mechanisms defined by the underlying network layer such as
      802.1TSN.
    </t>
   <t>
     A baseline set of QoS capabilities for DetNet flows carried in PWs
     and MPLS can provided by MPLS with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
     <xref target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>.  TE LSPs can
     also support explicit routes (path pinning).  Current service
     definitions for packet TE LSPs can be found in "Specification of
     the Controlled Load Quality of Service", <xref target="RFC2211"/>,
     "Specification of Guaranteed Quality of Service", <xref
     target="RFC2212"/>, and "Ethernet Traffic Parameters", <xref
     target="RFC6003"/>. Additional service definitions are expected in
     future documents to support the full range of DetNet services.
     In all cases, the existing label-based marking mechanisms defined
     for TE-LSPs and even E-LSPs are use to support the identification
     of flows requiring DetNet QoS.
   </t>
   <t>
     QoS for DetNet flows carried in IPv6 MUST be provided locally by
     the DetNet-aware hosts and routers supporting DetNet flows.  Such
     support will leverage the underlying network layer such as
     802.1TSN.  The traffic control mechanisms used to deliver QoS for
     IP encapsulated DetNet flows are expected to be defined in a future
     document.  From an encapsulation perspective, and as defined in
     <xref target="v6Solution"/>, the combination of the Flow Label
     together with the IP source address uniquely identifies a DetNet
     flow.
   </t>
   <t>
   Packets that are marked with a DetNet Class of Service value, but that have not been
   the subject of a completed reservation, can disrupt the QoS offered to properly
   reserved DetNet flows by using resources allocated to the reserved flows.  Therefore,
   the network nodes of a DetNet network SHOULD:

	</list>
  </t><t>
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
          Defend the DetNet QoS by discarding or remarking (to a non-DetNet CoS)
          packets received that are not the subject of a completed reservation.
      </t><t>
          Not use a DetNet reserved resource, e.g. a queue or shaper reserved for
          DetNet flows, for any packet that does not carry a DetNet Class of Service
          marker.
      </t>

 <section title="Cross-DetNet flow resource aggregation" anchor="Aggregation">
   <t>
     The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
     resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
     for improving scaling of control in the data, management and
     control planes.  This document identifies the traffic identification
     related aspects of aggregation of DetNet flows.  The resource
     control and management aspects of aggregation (including the
     queuing/shaping/policing implications) will be covered in other
     documents.  The data plane implications of aggregation are
     independent for PW/MPLS and IP encapsulated DetNet flows.
   </t>
   <t>
     DetNet flows transported via MPLS can leverage MPLS-TE's existing
     support for hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs), see <xref
     target="RFC4206"/>.  H-LSPs are typically used to aggregate control
     and resources, they may also be used to provide OAM or protection
     for the aggregated LSPs.  Arbitrary levels of aggregation naturally
     falls out of the definition for hierarchy and the MPLS label stack
     <xref target="RFC3032"/>.  DetNet nodes which support aggregation
     (LSP hierarchy) map one or more LSPs (labels) into and from an
     H-LSP.  Both carried LSPs and H-LSPs may or may not use the TC
     field, i.e., L-LSPs or E-LSPs.  Such nodes will need to ensure that
     traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued)
     onto the H-LSPs in a fashion that ensures the required DetNet
     service is preserved.
   </t>
   <t>
     DetNet flows transported via IP have more limited aggregation
     options, due to the available traffic flow identification fields of
     the IP solution.  One available approach is to manage the resources
     associated with a DSCP identified traffic class and to map (remark)
     individually controlled DetNet flows onto that traffic class.  This
     approach also requires that nodes support aggregation ensure that
     traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued)
     in a fashion that ensures the required DetNet service is preserved.
    <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Comment #38">
	   SB> I am sure we can do better than this with SR, or the use of
            routing techniques that map certain addresses to certain paths.

     In both the MPLS and IP cases, additional details of the traffic control
     capabilities needed at a DetNet-aware node may be covered in the
     new service descriptions mentioned above or in separate future
     documents.  Management and control plane mechanisms will also need
     to ensure that the service required on the aggregate flow (H-LSP or
     DSCP) are provided, which may include the  discarding or remarking
     mentioned in the previous sections.
   </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Bidirectional traffic">
  <t>
    Some DetNet applications generate bidirectional traffic.  Using MPLS
    definitions <xref target="RFC5654"/> there are associated bidirectional flows, and co-routed bidirectional flows.
    MPLS defines a point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP as
    consisting of two unidirectional point-to-point LSPs, one from A to
    B and the other from B to A, which are regarded as providing
    a single logical bidirectional transport path.  This would be
    analogous of standard IP routing, or PWs running over two reciprocal
    unidirection LSPs.  MPLS defines a point-to-point co-routed
    bidirectional LSP as an associated bidirectional LSP which satisfies
    the additional constraint that its two unidirectional component
    LSPs follow the same path (in terms of both nodes
    and links) in both directions.  An important property of co-routed bidirectional LSPs
    is that their unidirectional component LSPs share fate.  In both
    types of bidirectional LSPs, resource allocations may differ in each
    direction.  The concepts of associated bidirectional flows  and
    co-routed bidirectional flows can be applied to DetNet flows as well
    whether IPv6 or MPLS is used.
  </t>
  <t>
    While the IPv6 and MPLS data planes must support bidirectional DetNet flows, there
    are no special bidirectional features with respect to the data plane
    other than need for the two directions take the same paths.
    Fate sharing and associated vs co-routed bidirectional flows can be
    managed at the control level.
    Note,
    that there is no stated requirement for bidirectional DetNet flows
    to be supported using the same IPv6 Flow Labels or MPLS Labels in each direction.
    Control mechanisms will need to support such bidirectional flows for
    both IPv6 and MPLS, but such mechanisms are out of scope of this
    document.  An example control plane solution for MPLS can be found
    in <xref target="RFC7551"/>.

 <section title="Layer 2 addressing and QoS Considerations">
    <t>
        The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group have
        defined (and are defining) a number of amendments to <xref target="IEEE8021Q">IEEE 802.1Q</xref>
        that provide zero congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged networks.
        <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines packet replication and elimination
        functions that should prove both compatible with and useful to, DetNet networks.
    </t><t>
        As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge may need to
        identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet belongs in order to provide the
        TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It also will likely need a CoS marking, such as the
        priority field of an IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.
    </t><t>
        Although the flow identification methods described in <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>
        are flexible, and in fact, include IP 5-tuple identification methods, the baseline
        TSN standards assume that every Ethernet frame belonging to a TSN stream
        (i.e. DetNet flow) carries a multicast destination MAC address that is unique to that
        flow within the bridged network over which it is carried.  Furthermore,
        <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> describes three methods by which a packet
        sequence number can be encoded in an Ethernet frame.
    </t><t>
        Ensuring that the proper Ethernet VLAN tag priority and destination MAC address
        are used on a DetNet/TSN packet may require further clarification of the customary
        L2/L3 transformations carried out by routers and edge label switches.  Edge nodes
        may also have to move sequence number fields among Layer 2, PW, and IPv6 encapsulations.

  <t>When DetNet is used, there is an underlying assumption that the
  applicaton(s) require clock synchronization such as the Precision Time Protocol
  (PTP) [IEEE1588]. The relay nodes may or may not utilize clock synchronization
  in order to provide zero congestion loss and controlled latency delivery.  In either case, there are a

  <t><list style="symbols">

    PTP packets can be sent either as DetNet flows or as high-priority

    consideration to prevent unwanted interactions between clock-synchronized
    network nodes and the packets that synchronize the clocks.

    traffic is forwarded as a DetNet flow, and as such it is forwarded in a
    way that allows a low delay variation. However, since intermediate nodes
    do not take part in the synchronization protocol, this approach provides
    a relatively low degree of accuracy.</t>

    <t>PTP with on-path support: in this approach PTP packets are sent as
    ordinary or as DetNet flows, and intermediate nodes take part in the protocol as
    Transparent Clocks or Boundary Clocks [IEEE1588]. The on-path PTP
    support by intermediate nodes provides a higher degree of accuracy than
    the previous approach. The actual accuracy depends on whether all
    intermediate nodes are PTP-capable, or only a subset of them.</t>
  
    <t>Time-as-a-service: in this approach accurate time is provided
    as-a-service to the DetNet source and destination, as well as the
    intermediate nodes. Since traffic between the source and destination is
    sent over a provider network, if the provider supports
    time-as-a-service, then accurate time can be provided to both the source
    and the destination of DetNet traffic. This approach can potentially
    provide the highest degree of accuracy.</t>

  </list></t>

  <t>It is expected that the latter approach will be the most common one,
  as it provides the highest degree of accuracy, and creates a layer
  separation between the DetNet data and the synchronization service.</t>

  <t>It should be noted that in all four approaches it is not recommended
  to use replication and elimination for synchronization packets; the
  replication/elimination approach may in some cases reduce the
  synchronization accuracy, since the observed path delay will be
  bivalent.

<section title="Management and control considerations">
  <t>
    While management plane and control planes are traditionally
    considered separately, from the Data Plane perspective there is no
    practical difference based on the origin of flow provisioning
    information.  This document therefore does not distinguish between
    information provided by a control plane protocol, e.g., RSVP-TE <xref
    target="RFC3209"/> and <xref target="RFC3473"/>, or by a network
    management mechanisms, e.g., RestConf <xref target="RFC8040"/> and
    YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/>. 
 </t>
  <t>
   [Editor's note: This section is a work in progress.
   discuss here what kind of enhancements are needed for DetNet
   and specifically for PREF and DetNet zero congest loss and latency
   control. Need to cover both traffic control (queuing) and connection
   control (control plane).]
 </t>
 
 <section title="DetNet Label and IPv6 Flow Label assignment and distribution">
  <t>
   The PW label distribution follows the same mechanisms specified for MS-PW <xref
   target="RFC6073"/>. The details of the control plane protocol solution required for the label
   distribution and the management of the label number space are out of scope of this document. 
  </t>
  <t>
   The IPv6 Flow Label distribution and the label number space are out of scope of this document.
   However, it should be noted that the combination of the IPv6 source address and the IPv6 Flow
   Label is assumed to be unique within the DetNet-enabled network. Therefore, as long as each node
   is able to assign unique Flow Labels for the source address(es) it is using the DetNet-enabled
   network wide flow identification uniqueness is guaranteed. 
  </t>
 </section>
 <section title="Packet replication and elimination">
     <t>
         The control plane protocol solution required for managing the PREF processing
         is outside the scope of this document.
